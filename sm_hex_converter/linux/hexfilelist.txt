#Add your hex strings into this file. One hex string PER Line. Do not paste in newlines, instead press ENTER normally at the end of your hex string.
#Ensure it's properly formatted. For example AA B0 ? FF or AA B0 2A FF or \xAA\B0\x2A\FF
#Unlike the command line where you paste in a single hex memory string, do NOT sorround lines in this file with "" !
