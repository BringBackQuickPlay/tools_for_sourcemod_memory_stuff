Run the program using the .bat file in a Terminal/Cmd:

i.e

.\sm_hex_converter.bat [Options] [-filelist "path\to\file"|"HexStringHere"]

type .\sm_hex_converter.bat -h 
for help

The .ps1 file must be in the same folder as the .bat file.

hexfilelist.txt is a prepared .txt file you can use (must be in the same folder as the .bat and .ps1) where
you can convert several hex strings at once.
